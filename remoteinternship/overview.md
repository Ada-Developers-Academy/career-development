## Takeaways
- Set up a routine & workspace that distinguish work time from home time
- Ask effective questions by including:
  * The problem you're trying to solve
  * What you've already tried
  * What kind of help you're looking for
- Figure out how long you should spend investigating on your own before asking a question (timebox yourself)
- Communicate regularly with your mentor and manager – meet with your manager at least once a week and mentor more frequently than that
- Track your progress and share it proactively, and come prepared to 1:1s with questions and updates
- Get to know all your teammates
- Look for ways to get involved beyond your team – including Employee Resource Groups, Ada alum groups, etc.
- Reference [this orientation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MAwx0hoLY3d2OUa76xwjdqecv_RNcwIMdLiOIXTABhc/edit) to see what is expected of your manager/mentor.

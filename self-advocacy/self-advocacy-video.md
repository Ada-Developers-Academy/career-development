## Key Takeaways
- How can interns successfully advocate for what they need from their managers and teams that accommodate their different learning styles?
- How to get manager/mentor communication and a relationship back on track after a misunderstanding/initial disconnect? 
- Being empowered to speak up for what you need if you're not getting it at internship, whether that is more frequent check-ins, more pair programming, asking for feedback, clearer milestones for your project, any gaps in getting to SDE1 level by the end of internship and exactly how to address them, etc. 
- How to identify great advocates for your career within your team, how to get what you need while still learning so much and being new to the industry (with our team's support too).

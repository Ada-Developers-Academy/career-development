## Takeaways:

- Feel comfortable putting time on people’s calendar to get to know your team
- Time box your day and set boundaries between work and life
    * Set specific working hours
    * Move around, take breaks, walk away from your workstation sometimes!
    * It isn’t necessary or expected that you will work at night or on weekends
- It’s ok that you won’t know or understand a lot of things in the beginning - you can develop your depth and breadth of knowledge over time. 
- Listening in at standups and trying to understand team projects can help, also you can ask your mentor for a broad overview of the team’s systems + tools 
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help. However, have a process for figuring things out before you ask for help, list what you tried and your approach first. 
- Remember, you are there to learn first and foremost!

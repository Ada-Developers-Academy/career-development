## Takeaways

Takeaways: 
- The first few weeks are about learning the ropes, you might not be writing code right away and thatâ€™s ok!
- Proactively keep the lines of communication open with your manager and mentor, discuss your learning goals and set specific objectives to work toward. 
- Internship will make you a better developer, interviewing is a different skill set and takes practice and time! 
- You can start assessing and interviewing for jobs before you know if you will be converted at your internship. 
- Internship timeline 
  * March: Focus on getting to know your team and tools (don't worry about whiteboarding)
  * April: Focus on mastering basic data structures, taking on new things at internship (don't worry about Midpoint Review)
  * May: Focus on hitting your stride at internship, mastering more advanced data structures (don't worry about applying to jobs)
  * June: Focus on applying and interviewing (it's okay to ask your manager to take time off to interview)
  * July: Focus on getting an offer you're happy with (it's okay if you don't get one from your internship company)
